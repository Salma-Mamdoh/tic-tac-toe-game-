This repository contains implementations of Tic-Tac-Toe games in C++, Python, and Java. In addition to the traditional Tic-Tac-Toe game, this repository also includes an implementation of a Tic-Tac-Toe game with numbers, where players take turns writing numbers on a 3x3 board and the winner is the first person to complete a line that adds up to 15.</p> <h2>Python Implementation</h2> <p>The Python implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe with numbers is a developed version of the traditional Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game consists of a board of 3x3, and player 1 takes odd numbers (1,3, 5, 7, 9) while player 2 takes even numbers (0, 2, 4, 6, 8). Players take turns writing their numbers, and each player can use each number only once. The first person to complete a line that adds up to 15 is the winner.</p> <h2>Java Implementation</h2> <p>The Java implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe is a generic game that includes a board, players, and a game manager. The game manager is responsible for managing the flow of the game, while the board is responsible for keeping track of the state of the game. The players are represented by a base class, XoPlayer, which is inherited by the Player class that represents the players in the Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game manager, XOGameManager, is responsible for managing the flow of the game and determining the winner.</p> <h2>C++ Implementation</h2> <p>The C++ implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe is also an object-oriented implementation, with the game being divided into classes for the board, players, and game manager. The board class is responsible for keeping track of the state of the game, while the player class represents the players in the game. The game manager class, XOGameManager, is responsible for managing the flow of the game and determining the winner.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>Whether you're a beginner or an experienced programmer, the Tic-Tac-Toe repository has something for you. You can explore the code and experiment with the different implementations to deepen your understanding of the game and improve your programming skills. We encourage you to test the code thoroughly and to share any feedback or suggestions you may have.</p> </body> </html>
